## Project Description
In this project, we will develop an algorithm to solve the Totally-Looks-Like challenge. Our algorithm will take one image from a Totally-Looks-Like pair as input and attempt to find its match from
a list of possible candidates.

Whatever methods we choose, we are expected to evaluate these methods using the provided data,
to critically analyse the results, and to justify our design choices in our final report. Our evaluation should include error analysis, where we attempt to understand where our method works well and
where it fails.  

## Dataset Setup
Download the dataset from [here](https://canvas.lms.unimelb.edu.au/courses/154723/files/16636174?wrap=1). Then, unzip it and drag the folder into the root directory of this project.
